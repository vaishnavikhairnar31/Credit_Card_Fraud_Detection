# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a real-world machine learning problem where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions from a large number of legitimate ones.  
This dataset is highly **imbalanced**, which makes the problem challenging and realistic.

In this project, machine learning models are trained to detect fraudulent credit card transactions while focusing on **recall and F1-score**, which are more important than accuracy in fraud detection systems.
